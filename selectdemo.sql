/*Data is information such as facts and numbers used to analyze something or make decisions.*/
/*
Database is merely a structured collection of data.
Database is a collection of inter-related Tables.
Table is a collection of Records.
Record is a collection of fields.

The data relating to each other by nature, e.g., a product belonged to a product 
category and associated with multiple tags. Therefore, we use the term relational database.
A table may relate to another table using a relationship

 classicmodels- Database

/*An RDBMS is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a

#MySQL WHERE clause with the IN operator

-- The IN operator returns TRUE if a value matches any value in a list.
